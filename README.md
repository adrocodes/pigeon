## What is Pigeon

Pigeon is heavily focused on GraphQL based applications and for usage on the backend. Pigeon is built to make fragment & query composition easier, validating incoming data and transforming that data into a minimal shape that can be used by the application UI, shifting the complexity of data transformation to the server.

## How it works

With Pigeon you'll be defining a consistent schema for your data which includes a validation model using `zod`, incoming data will be validated against this data to ensure you get the data you're expecting. Additionally, creating dependencies between components will allow you to generate GraphQL queries and collect fragments for those queries to make the integration easy.
